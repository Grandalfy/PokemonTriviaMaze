Thank you downloading this game!

Requirements:
Install Java
Install Java JDK 15: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk15-archive-downloads.html
Install the "PKMN RBYGSC" font in the /installation/fonts folder

System Requirements:
Should be able to run on a potato, but please at least have a 1080p resolution screen.
The game is designed to always be at 1080p so having a smaller screen size will break the visuals!

Installation Process:
To install the game onto your machine launch "Pokemon Trivia Setup".
Follow the instructions from the setup to install the game.
This will install the game to Program Files x86 and add a shortcut to your desktop!
To play launch the "Pokemon Trivia Maze.jar".
If that doesn't work launch "RunGame.bat" in the source folder.

As a last resort, if the program won't run on the jar/bat file then you could try importing the
project folder to Eclipse Java IDE which we developed the game on. Then run from that.
