"Pokemon Trivia Maze v1.0"
Created by: AJ Downey, Kenneth Ahrens, and Katelyn Malone
Spring 2021

To play launch the "Pokemon Trivia Game.jar". If that doesn't work launch "RunGame.bat" in the source TriviaMaze folder.

This is a fan-made-non-profit project based on the "Who's that Pokemon?" segment from the original Pokemon anime.
The objective is to move through the maze by answering "Who's that Pokemon?" and reach the end goal.
